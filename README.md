## README: JW Player

Thank you for downloading JW Player 6, the world's most popular HTML5/Flash video player! See [About JW Player](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28832/about-jw-player) for an overview of supported browsers/devices, as well as a more detailed feature list. See the [Release Notes](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28835/release-notes) if you want to learn what changed with this latest release.

---

### Quick Start

Copy the **jwplayer** folder that contains this README to the www root of your website. Next, include the *jwplayer.js* script in the \<head\> of your HTML page.

If you have purchased the [Pro, Premium or Ads edition](http://www.longtailvideo.com/jw-player/pricing/) of JW Player, its features can be activated by inserting your server-less JW Player license key in the second line:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="/jwplayer/jwplayer.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">jwplayer.key="ABCDEFGHIJKLMOPQ";</script>

Note: A key is not required to use the Free edition, but will still be available from your [JW Player Account](https://account.longtailvideo.com/). Including your key will enable the free [JW Player Analytics](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28852/using-jw-player-analytics) for your account.

#### Embed Code

When the script and key are set, scroll down to the \<body\> of your HTML page and insert the JW Player embed code at the place you want your video to appear:

    <div id="myElement">Loading the player...</div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        jwplayer("myElement").setup({
            file: "/uploads/myVideo.mp4",
            image: "/uploads/myPoster.jpg"
        });
    </script>

See [Embedding JW Player](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28839/embedding-the-player) for a more elaborate description of options and some example embeds.

*Note two very common issues prevent smooth video playback in Internet Explorer 9/10. First, you need to set **\<!DOCTYPE html\>** to prevent triggering IE's compatibility mode. Second, your videos must be served with the **video/mp4** mimetype. Not doing so will cause IE not to play them. See our [troubleshooting guide](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28840/troubleshooting-your-setup) for more common issues.*

#### Premium Skins

If you have purchased the Premium or Ads edition of the player, your player includes a set of Premium skins. These skins can be downloaded from your [JW Player Account](https://account.longtailvideo.com/), but you can also load them off our CDN by simply inserting the skin name:

        skin: "bekle"

See [Using JW Player Skins](http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/jw-player/28846/using-jw-player-skins) for more info.
